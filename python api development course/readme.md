this is a 19 hour course i am gonna do. I will begin it today, and try to complete a good part of it this semester

the course is 19 hours long, with a quarter of it unnecessary.

if i complete 2 hours worth of it every week, then i can complete it in it's entirety this semester. I will try to track my changes, and upload code examples here.
